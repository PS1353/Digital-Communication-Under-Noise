Why is digital communication important?
The whole world learned why digital communication was important throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 
If a business hadn’t already asked themselves, “what is digital communication?” prior to the pandemic,
they would have had to in order to stay afloat because many could not operate in person or at least not at full capacity.

Meetings shifted to video conference calls,
and email became the main way coworkers communicated with one another.
making it abundantly clear how important digital communication is. 
Social distancing also meant that friends and family couldn’t gather like they used to,
so they had to rely on texts, social media, and video calls to stay connected.

Beyond the pandemic, digital communication was important for a variety of other reasons.

Firstly, it’s important for governments because of how popular digital communication is among the population.
Citizens aren’t asking questions like “what is digital communication?”
they’re wondering why many governments have been slower to adopt it and offer the digital services they expect to see.


Digital communication is important for governments, not just because citizens expect more of it from governments,
but also because governments can get citizens more meaningfully engaged by using digital communication.

Digital communication can also streamline many processes and make communication between different local governments or agencies easier.
This frees up time for more important tasks and can reduce miscommunication or generally poor internal communication.
